# React + Vite with Tailwind CSS

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It also includes Tailwind CSS for rapid and efficient styling.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Installation

Make sure to run the following command after downloading the project:

- npm install
  
This will install the necessary dependencies to get the project up and running, including Tailwind CSS.
